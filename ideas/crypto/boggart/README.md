## Solution

TL;DR

1. Recognize that `Wizard` is a class that calculates numbers of Lucas sequence, where `cast_riddikulus` is an exponentiation function, and `boggart` is a power.
2. Since then recognize LUC cryptosystem, it uses `N = p * q` just like RSA
3. `cast_riddikulus` has linear complexity, so we need to rewrite it as a binary exponentiation function, using some Lucas sequence properties
4. Recover `p, q` primes using `neutral_magic` hint and Hensel lifting method
5. Recover public exponent `e` using known pair `PT-CT` and Meet-in-the-middle method
6. Calculate private exponent `d` and decrypt the flag

Here is my not optimized solution, it works for about a few minutes.
